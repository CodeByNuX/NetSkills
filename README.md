# NetSkills â€“ Subnetting Practice Tool

NetSkills is a simple Python script I created while studying for the CCNA to help reinforce subnetting concepts through hands-on practice.

It randomly generates private IP addresses and subnet masks, then prompts you to answer:

- Network ID  
- Broadcast Address  
- First Usable IP  
- Last Usable IP

After you enter your responses, the tool provides immediate feedback and shows the correct answers.
